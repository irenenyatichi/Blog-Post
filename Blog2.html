    <h1>NOAH'S USE OF HUMOR </h1>
    <p class="para">Humor is the act of being hilarious. It is one of the styles writers use to add some “flavour” to their works or pieces. Trevor Noah in his autobiography , Born A Crime, has various instances of humor. He used humor in his life for various things, thereby, passing a unique message to his readers . Below are some instances where he used his humor:

    Trevor Noah went to a Catholic school, where he became one of the few students of color. He was also unfortunate enough to become a non-Catholic. Partaking of the sacrament is part of being Catholic. He did not understand why only Catholics took part in the practice. 
    As he continues with his recount of events, he humorously explains how he questioned the practice and decided to break the rules.
    On one morning before mass he decided to get himself some Jesus’ blood and Jesus’ body. He snuck behind the altar and drank the entire bottle of grape juice the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other time. One morning before mass he decided, I’m going to get me some Jesus blood and Jesus body. He snuck behind the altar and I drank the entire bottle of grape juice and I ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times that he couldn’t. A kid reported him during the confessions time and the priest who was told turned him in.

    There was also this time when Patricia , his mother, forced them to go to church despite their car breaking down. Since they went to three different churches in one Sunday, night time caught up with them while they were leaving the last Church. After a long time they boarded a car  but they ended up in a  van belonging to a Zulu. 
    Unfortunately, the driver and Patricia disagreed and in order for them to be safe, Patricia had to wrap herself in order to protect  Trevor Noah’s baby brother to avoid getting hurt. Trevor Noah using humor describes this ordeal that would have otherwise been a sombre one. He says that he rolled on the tarmac and when his mother ordered him to run, 
    animal instinct made him run and nobody ran like him and his mother, reigning champions of Maryvale College Sports Day. He explains that when he glanced back the men had a bewildered look on their faces,they could not believe it.</p>
