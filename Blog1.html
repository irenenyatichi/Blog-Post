    <h1>THEMES IN BORN A CRIME</h1>
    <p class="para">On this blog post I would like to talk about a particular paragraph on Trevor Noah's Book, Born a Crime: 
    <i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman
    like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. 
    The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient,but he never falls in love with subservient women. 
    He’s attracted to independent women.“He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."</i>

    Abel was Trevor Noah's step-father and a mechanic. Noah initially describes Abel as charming, hilarious,
            took care of his family and always offered a helping hand. He and Patricia got married and a year later they
            had Trevor Noah's baby brother, Andrew.
            When they went to Abel's home in Tzaneen, he realised the Tsonga culture, Abel's culture was extremely
            patriachial.
            Wikipedia refers to patriarchy as a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles
            of political
            leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. He explains this by giving several
            examples like how women were
            to bow while greeting men, how men were allowed to kill animals but never to step foot in the kitchen
            , how he was allowed to leave his bed unmade in order for him to go out and play, while girls his age were
            made to
            help their mothers in doing house chores. When Abel married Patricia he was well aware of the type of lady
            she was,
            which was not his preferred traditional type, but still went ahead and married her. For this I think he was
            at fault.

            <br>
            Patricia was a lady with a no nonsense attitude and with a high personality. She however put up with Abel's
            nature,
            for reasons like Jesus had a reason among other reasons only known to her. He used to beat her with fists
            and also a bicycle in one instance
            and even though he did it numerous times, she stayed with him. We are told of how if occured after every few
            years.
            In the years between the violence Abel, used to do his 'good deeds' in order to maybe cover-up for what he
            had done.
            Even in todays' world there are still some women who choose to bear with their husbands violence for various
            reasons.
            These reasons include but are not limited to their children's livelihood and reaction towards separation or
            divorce and
            the state of being comfortable in a certain situation.
